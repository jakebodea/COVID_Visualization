# COVID_Visualization

Greetings, thank you for viewing my project. The one note I have is to make sure that the files are all downloaded and in the same folder, afterwhich COVID_Visualization.py must be ran via the terminal. 

The correct system parameters are: <deaths/cases> <county> 

If the name of the county has more than one word, it must be put in quotes. Regardless, make sure the county is capitalized correctly.
