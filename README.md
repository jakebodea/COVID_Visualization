# COVID_Visualization

Greetings, thank you for viewing my project. The one note I have is to make sure that the files are all downloaded and in the same folder, afterwhich COVID_Visualization.py must be ran via the terminal:

_python COVID_Visualization.py [deaths/cases] [county]_

If the name of the county has more than one word, it must be put in quotes. Regardless, **make sure the county is capitalized correctly.** For example:

_python COVID_Visualization.py deaths "Los Angeles"_
